# Hi, I'm Aydan!👋

I'm software engineering student based in Canada.

I love building, testingm and breaking things to understand how they work.

If an idea pops into my head, I’ll usually turn it into a project — whether it’s for class, co-op, or just because I’m curious.

My main tech stack is React, TypeScript, Java, and Python, but I’m always experimenting with new tools.
I’m also comfortable with testing frameworks, debugging workflows, and digging into the details of how systems behave.

I’ve worked on projects ranging from game logic and MVC architectures to data transmission research and rover simulations.
And I’m always looking for the next thing to build or improve.

If you want to see how I work, check out my projects — I’m constantly adding new ones.
